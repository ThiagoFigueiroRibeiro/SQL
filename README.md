# SQL

Some SQL code. 

0001 - Wine: This is an exercise from my Database class. We must create a table called "Adega" (Wine house) with some columns. Then, the "dep" collumn from Adega must be turned into the Primary Key. Finally, we must insert several values to the table. Additionally, we must ask the table simple queries like "Give me the 'vinho' and 'produtor' values from the adega table where dep is '72'", for instance.
